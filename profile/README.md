## ✨About Our Project 
AweSUM is a web service that helps to improve learning efficiency, in on-line lecturing environments. 
It achieves this by automatically summarizing video lectures and providing addtional functions that can help boost learning.

## ✨Quick Start Guide
1. Enter a link of a **English lecture video that supports closed caption** to the **"Enter URL"** tab. 
(eg : https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yIdF-17HwSk )
2. The YouTube video starts streaming at the top.
3. Enter a specific keyword you aim to search in the **"Enter Key-Word"** tab on the right side and click the **"Enter"** button. You can check that the pairs of time stamps and the corresponding sentences where the keyword appears throughout the entire lecture are provided.
4. If you scroll down, you select the **"LONG"** radio button and **"GENERATE"** the long summary. After some amount of loading time, a long extractive summary is generated and shown on the pop-up window.
5. You close the pop-up window and this time you select the **"MEDIUM"** radio button and **"GENERATE"** the medium length summary. After some amount of loading time, a medium length generative summary is generated and shown on the pop-up window. 
* Extractive Summary - A summary consisting of only the sentences contained in the original text
* Generative Summary - Summarized sentences that are not included in the original text
6. You scroll down once again and click the **"시작하기"** button of the OX quiz. Quiz questions of the lecture are generated and shown.
7. You select the radio buttons corresponding to the answers of the questions and press the **""VIEW RESULTS"** button to check the result. The wrong answers are displayed in red.
